Solutions I came up with.
Diwali Lights has the solution it had because I tilted a bit when my initial slicing up of the problem caused some inelegant (though very small scale) encapsulation and repetition problems.
Beautiful Number should work reasonably for pretty large numbers I think.
Partitioning Number is definitely not scalable much further than the examples provided (it takes about a minute already).
SortingArray just seems to require some VERY non-obvious insight.
